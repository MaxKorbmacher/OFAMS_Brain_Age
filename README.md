Analyses on the longitudinal OFAMS Multiple Sclerosis (MS) MRI data using Brain Age

The study is based on a clinical trial where omega 3 fatty acids were provided to MS patients. While the omega 3 treatment was not successful, the patients were frequently followed up, every month during the first year of the study (m1-m12), and then more sporadically, at m12, m24 and m120 (10-year follow-up).

A Gadolinium tracer was used during MRI (T1-weighted FLASH) aquisition.
